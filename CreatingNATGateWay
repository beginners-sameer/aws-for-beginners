Create a NAT Gateway under VPC section
put the nat gateway under subnet "Public2B"
give the name : my-security-ngw
Allocate the Elastic IP
Connectivity Type should be public.

Go to Private RT "Security-PrivateRT"
Edit the Routes
add the NAT gateway.

Now try to login to bastion host and then ssh to any of the private instances using " ssh ec2-user@privatipoftheinstances -i security.pem "  then try to run
sudo yum update -y , see whether it works or not

Now you have installed apache on both the private instances.

How can you access the website publicly?

Create a Classic LB with new SG created with only 80 ports getting allowed.
Choose both public subnets
Choose then private ec2 instances
HTTP PORT 80 should be in the listener mode
Health check - TCP
