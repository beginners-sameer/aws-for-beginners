_____________________________

Modified the route table of private subnet A
by adding

____________________________

After this login to bastion host first
then do ssh into private ec2 instance
then try to perform

ping google.com
curl https://example.com 
curl https://google.com

so this shows that your private ec2 instance can connect to internet and download required components using NAT Gateway
