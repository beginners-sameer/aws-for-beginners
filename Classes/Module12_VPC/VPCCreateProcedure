10.0.0.0/16  my vpc range

subnet creation:
Public_1A   under 1a AZ
10.0.1.0/24  - cidr block

Private_1A  under 1a AZ
10.0.2.0/24  - cidr block

Public_1B  under 1b AZ
10.0.20.0/24 - cidr block

Private_1B  under 1b AZ
10.0.21.0/24 - cidr block

Now Create an IGW:
my-webinar-IGW
Attach it to your vpc

Create a Public RT:
Public Route Table

Create a Private RT:
Private Route Table

In Public RT, add the IGW:

Now Associate the subnets in your Private RT first:
Choose the private rt first and choose private subnets 1a & 1b

now do the same kind of associate to your public RT with public subnets

Now EDIT DNS HOSTNAMES in the VPC

Launch one instance from public and private subnet
Create 1st instance on public_1a
Create a new SG with some name "Webinar-Public-SG" and allow only ssh
Create 2nd instance on private_1b
Create a new SG with some name "Webinar-Private-SG" and delete the ssh

connect to the public instance and ping google.com, you will get a reply
Now try to ping the private ip of the 2ndinstance from here.. you won't get any reply. why ?

Now you need to go to 2nd private instance's security group and add ICMP protocol and give the source as "public security group"

Create VPC Peering:
Create new vpc with 10.1.0.0/16 
Create new subnet with 10.1.1.0/24 under 1a as public-new-subnet
Launch an instance in this vpc & subnet with the ssh allow anywhere
create the igw and attach it to the new vpc
Go to route table, you will have only one route table related to the above vpc
Add a new route entry allowing all ips "0.0.0.0/0" to new IGW
connec to this instance
Try to ping the instance 2 from instance 1 - it iwll not work

go to vpc peering and create the connection, accept the requests
go to rt of the new vpc and add the new record for 1st vpc and choosing peering connection
do the same for webinar vpc add the new record for 2nd vpc and choosing peering connection

add the security group rule in the new vpc ec2 instance
