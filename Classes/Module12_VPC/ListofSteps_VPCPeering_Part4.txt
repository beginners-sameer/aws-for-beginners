We are going to peer the new vpc with the default vpc

edit the tag name from empty to "default vpc" in the default VPC

Launch an ec2 instance first in default vpc with ssh port open by creating new sg without any keypair

Now take the bastion host instance private ip and the newly launched instance above in default vpc and compare the private ips.
It's both in different network.

Bastion host - 10.0.15.227
new ec2 in default vpc - 172.31.25.131

Connect to Bastion host 
install apache
creat some sample index.html
start the apache
run the below command
curl privateipofthisinstance:80    // you should get some response


Now connect to ec2instance from the default vpc
try to run the same curl command from here
curl privateipofbastionhostinstance:80   // it will nto work

because both are in different network
