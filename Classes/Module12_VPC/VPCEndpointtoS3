Summary:
Assign an s3 role to a private ec2 instance first
Try to connect to the above ec2 instance using bastion host or jump server
once it's connected, then try to execute the command "aws s3 ls".. 
If it's not working, then we have to create NAT gateway and put that NAT gateway into public ip.
now verify whether aws s3 ls command is working or not.
If it's working then the connection is happening through NAT gateway to fetch the s3 details into the private ec2 instance.
Delete the NAT gateway and try to access "aws s3 ls" - it will not work.

Now we will introduce the VPC endpoint which will not go through internet rather it will be inside the aws network itself.
Create a vpc endpoint / chosoe the right vpc / put this endpoint into the private subnet / choose the endpoint for s3 gateway / put this entry in the private route table
now try to access aws s3 ls.. it should work. 

now the connection is happening inside aws network using vpc gateway endpoint concept.
