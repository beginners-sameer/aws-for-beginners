#Creating a bucket
Bucket name
aws region
object ownership : Keeping this as ACL disabled
Enable Block all public access
Create Bucket
Now the in the buckets dashboard, it would say Buckets and Objects not public

#Modification
Now all the public access on the same bucket and verify the bucket dashboard.
Now it would says "Objects can be public"

#Upload an object as an image.
don't change any object permissions
Verify whether it's opening with the object url
It would says Access Denied

And we can't edit the object permissions ACL as we already made it disabled when we created the bucket in the first step.

#edit the bucket policy permissions
and try to access the object url now
