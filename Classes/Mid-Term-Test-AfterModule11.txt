3. I am running a Media Streaming company called "MovileFlix". Team has found out that Processing of a Video is interrupted in one of the EC2 instances which is running with M5.large. However the video processing have been resumed in another available instance.

23. A customer relationship management (CRM) application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple
Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer
If one of these instances fails, what occurs?
A) The load balancer will stop sending requests to the failed instance.
B) The load balancer will terminate the failed instance.
C) The load balancer will automatically replace the failed instance.
D) The load balancer will return 504 Gateway Timeout errors until the instance is replaced.

24. A solutions architect wants to design a solution to save costs for Amazon EC2 instances that do not
need to run during a 2-week company shutdown. The applications running on the instances store data in
instance memory (RAM) that must be present when the instances resume operation.
Which approach should the solutions architect recommend to shut down and resume the instances?
A) Modify the application to store the data on instance store volumes. Reattach the volumes while restarting
them.
B) Snapshot the instances before stopping them. Restore the snapshot after restarting the instances.
C) Run the applications on instances enabled for hibernation. Hibernate the instances before the shutdown.
D) Note the Availability Zone for each instance before stopping it. Restart the instances in the same
Availability Zones after the shutdown.

25.  A company needs to maintain access logs for a minimum of 5 years due to regulatory requirements.
The data is rarely accessed once stored, but must be accessible with one dayâ€™s notice if it is needed.
What is the MOST cost-effective data storage solution that meets these requirements?
A) Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage and delete the objects after 5 years using a
lifecycle rule.
B) Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard storage and transition to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days using a
lifecycle rule.
C) Store the data in logs using Amazon CloudWatch Logs and set the retention period to 5 years.
D) Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent  Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage and delete the
objects after 5 years using a lifecycle rule.

26. A company uses Reserved Instances to run its data-processing workload. The nightly job typically
takes 7 hours to run and must finish within a 10-hour time window. The company anticipates temporary
increases in demand at the end of each month that will cause the job to run over the time limit with the
capacity of the current resources. Once started, the processing job cannot be interrupted before
completion. The company wants to implement a solution that would allow it to provide increased capacity
as cost-effectively as possible.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A) Deploy On-Demand Instances during periods of high demand.
B) Create a second Amazon EC2 reservation for additional instances.
C) Deploy Spot Instances during periods of high demand.
D) Increase the instance size of the instances in the Amazon EC2 reservation to support the increased
workload.
