yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1> This is the Cat Food Ordering Server </h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo "<h1> Please wait, we are processing your Cat Food Processing transaction </h1>" > /var/www/html/cat.html

#Login to cat machine and change the port # so that it can open only in 8080
