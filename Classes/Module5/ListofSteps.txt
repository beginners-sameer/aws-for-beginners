sudo file -s /dev/xvdf    if it returns like below /dev/xvdf: data  which means file system is not created
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf  // this will create the file system
mkdir /home/ec2-user/ebstesting
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/ebstesting
touch sameeer.txt under /home/ec2-user/ebstesting

sudo blkid  // this will give the UUID for each file system

open /etc/fstab file in vi editor
