Record name - latency.awsbeginners.link

ec2-one  -> mumbai
ec2-two  -> north viriginia
ec2-three -> London

TTL - 300 secs
Routing Policy - Latency
Region - choose the instance region
Record id - us-east-1 or any name which you identify as it's US

On the same page, create another record
Record name - latency.awsbeginners.link

TTL - 300 secs
Routing Policy - Latency

Record id - London


On the same page, create another record
Record name - latency.awsbeginners.link
