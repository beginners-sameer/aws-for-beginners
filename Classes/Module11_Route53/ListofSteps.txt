1. Open the one-click deployment
2. Assign the elastic ip to the running instance
3. Create a bucket called "www.sameertheawsguy.com"  - us-east-1 region
4. Uncheck "public access"  means open to public
5. Upload these 2 files which is under folder "Module11_Route53\r53_zones_and_failover\02_a4lfailover"
6. Enable Static WebSite Hosting on this bucket
7. Update the bucket policy which is assigned in the folder. Make sure to replace the ARN with your bucket ARN.

__ now we have setup our primary endpoint as our ec2 instance using one click deployment and failover endpoint as our s3 bucket__

1. Go to Route53 services -> Health Check -> Click Create Health Check -> Give some name for the health check like "A4L HealthCheck"
2. What to monitor -> Endpoint
3. Specifiy endpoint by -> IP address
4. Protocol -> HTTP
5. Get the Elastic IP of the ec2 instance and put it in here
6. path -> index.html
7. Advanced Configuration -> Request interval - 10 secs
8. Click Next
9. Dont' set any alarm
10.click next
11. it will be in unavailable status as it's verifying the initial health check
12. In the meantime, select the particular healthcheck which you have created -> select the down tab called "Health checkers"
13. so you could see that already our primary endpoint is getting passed from all over the region
14. After 2-5 mins, the healthcheck for the primary endpoint will be GREEN

________________________________________________

Now we are going to create Primary Failover record in our Hosted Zone
1.Click on Hosted Zones
2.Choose your domain name "sameertheawsguy.com"
3.Create record
4.Choose Failover
5.subdomain - www
6.TTL - 1 min
7.Leave the Record type as A
8.Define Failover record
9. Route Traffic to -> Choose IP address or another value -> put the public/elastic ip of the instance
10. Failover record type as "Primary"
11. Healthcheckid - choose the recent one which you have created
12. RecordID should be unique among the records. So give "EC2"
13. click Define Failover Record

______________________________________________________

Now we are going to create Secondary Failover record in our Hosted Zone
1. Click on Define Failover Record
2. Route Traffic to -> Alias to s3 website endpoint -> choose the righ region of the bucket -> choose the right bucket
3. Failover Record type -> secondary
4. Don't choose any health check also switch off the "evaluate target health"
5. Record ID "s3"
6. Click on Create Records


_______________________________________________________

Now try to explore http://www.sameertheawsguy.com -> you will get a page from ec2 instance from this location /var/www/html/index.html

Now we will simulate the failover by stopping the ec2 instance.
Go to Route53 page and Choose the recently created HealthCheck -> Click Health Checkers tab - you would see lot of failure connections and also it will become red.

After few minutes you will get the different page.
Now we will start the instance and verify that your health check will be up and the website will be up and running.
This would take couple of minutes
