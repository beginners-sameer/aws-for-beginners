1. create a record called "myapp.awsbeginners.link"
2. Record type = CNAME
3. Get the ALB dns name based on the previous demo on TTL
   demo-alb-route53-803219870.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com
4. Routing = simple routing
5. Create record

This would take 10-15 mins to reflect on the browser

1.Record name - only awsbeginners.link
2.Record type - CNAME
3.Value - put the alb dns name 
4. Leave the rest
5. Create record - it won't allow. 

Lesson is not possible to create a cname record with apex record.. apex means here "awsbeginners.link"

Now try to do the same using Alias:
1. Create a record
2. Record name - only awsbeginners.link
3. Record type - A
4. Enable Alias
5. Route traffic to "Alias to Application Load Balancer"
6. Choose the ap-south-1 region
7. 5. choose the ALB
8. Routing policy - simple routing
9. Toggle "evaluate target health"
10. Create Record
