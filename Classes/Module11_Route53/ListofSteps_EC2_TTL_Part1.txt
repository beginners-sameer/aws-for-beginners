# Setup 3 EC2 instances, each in different region
For example:
ec2-one  -> mumbai
ec2-two  -> north viriginia
ec2-three -> London

Put the below user data boot strapping script in all the 3 instances:

#! /bin/bash
# Use this for your user data 
# install httpd ( Linux 2 Version )
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
EC2_AVAIL_ZONE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
echo "<h1> Hello AWS Engineers from $(hostname -f) in AZ $EC2_AVAIL_ZONE </h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

Make sure ssh and http is allowed in security group
________________________________

List out the public instances of 3 instances like this :
ec2-one  - 3.110.174.147
ec2-two  - 3.87.133.233
ec2-three- 18.169.240.161

In Mumbai Region:

Create an ALB with listener priority 80 with internet facing
IP address - ipv4
Choose the default vpc 
Choose all the availability zones
Choose the Security group which has 80 open from all sources

Create the target group -> Targettype = instances -> Protocol =http-80 -> 
Health check Protocol -> HTTP - / 

Click Next and choose the avialable instances in mumbai region which will be only one
Click on including as pending below
Click "create target group"

Go back to ALB page refreshed the TG drop down and select the newly created target group there.
click on Create load Balancer

Get the DNS name of the ALB:
demo-alb-route53-803219870.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com

________________________________

Now verify below ips/dns names are hitting in browser or not
ec2-one  - 3.110.174.147  - mumbai
ec2-two  - 3.87.133.233   - north virginia
ec2-three- 18.169.240.161 - london
demo-alb-route53-803219870.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com

How TTL works?

Create a new record called "demo.awsbeginners.link"
Choose Record type as 'A'
gIVE THE PUBLIC EC2 INSTANCE IP OF mumbai in the value section
TTL - 2 minutes
Routing policy - simple

Now try to run the dig command in cloudshell, you will see the TTL will be counting to 120 secs.

In between try to change the A record type to london public ec2 instance ip and verify whether the demo.awsbeginners.link is opening the old mumbai ip or the london ip instance.


Note : Don't terminate any instances or ALB, because this is needed for next Part2 file
